1. Preferred way to pass a "JSON" data  
  a. res.json()     - recommended / preferred
  b. res.send()     - can be used but not recommended

2. Usually there should be "/api/v1/<route name>"
  - "/api"            - identify as an api route
  - "/v1"             - api version
  - "/<route name>"   - specific name of the route path
